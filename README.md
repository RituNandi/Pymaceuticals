Pymaceuticals - assignment 5
As a senior data analyst at the company Pymaceuticals, Inc., I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

# Summary of the Study Results - 
* Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be two drug regimens that work best to reduce tumor volume. Whereas Infubinol and Ceftamin are the least impactful drug regimens
* Effect of different drug regimens, on Male and female mouses, are almost similar
* With Capomulin treatment, tumor volume seems to first increase but after around 20th day, it starts to decrease hugely
* Mouse weight vs average tumor volume looks correlated. When weight is higher, tumor volume seems higher, too.
